# Classifying Misanthropies 
## Written by Richard Pham 

This article is, in no way, being written by artificial intelligence. So do not be alarmed about artificial 
intelligence becoming misanthropic and then proceeding to mass shootings of people. These are just a few items, 
worthy of mention, on how misanthropy starts. It must be assumed that misanthropy is not an innate quality, for 
it is a potent and concentrated force that could not have been forged into any human being upon their inception 
into this world. This is a theory, neverthless put forth as a matter of fact. The madness of proving metaphysical 
underpinnings must already gear some people to choose to listen to some things and to turn blind eyes to others. 

Misanthropy and helplessness. Those that have experienced situations where they could not seek adequate help 
would come to conclusions, to themselves, on the worthlessness of human skills, prestige, and influence. These 
three aspects to humanity are very self-serving because they require source (the human), investment (capital), 
and representation (projection of human image and likenesses). The source could radiate outwards, and oftentimes, 
an adequately autonomous source would choose who to radiate to and what to radiate to them. So there is choice, 
and there are decisions. Misanthropy consists of sentiments built on top of conclusions that many human decisions 
made were catastrophic, in physical form, or disadvantageous for the way things were to proceed. Misanthropes come 
to distrust the convenient help that seems to arrive to them. Misanthropic mentality that tends to the absolutist 
way of judgment will conclude that since help of a certain form did not arrive in a timely and proper manner, 
subsequent help can do no more mending than insult. Subsequent help could, in fact, be part of chained premeditation 
of control by the perpetrating organization that chose not to properly help at the right time. Misanthropy that is 
based on reactionary mechanisms to helplessness will also tend towards privatization of one form or another. These 
statements so far made on this kind of misanthropy are difficult to argue against, yet provide so little definitive 
detail on how misanthropes may conduct themselves. Yet, it is foolish to blanket the term "misanthrope" on a person, 
so long as they remain connected to other sources constituting stimuli to them, other humans included. 

Misanthropy and betrayal. This correlation is similar to that of helplessness, and may even entirely fall under 
the category of helplessness, but the kinds of betrayals positive in action are different from that of helplessness. 
Positive betrayals are those that require the traitor to make pro-active efforts to harm the betrayed, while 
negative betrayals require nothing more than an apathy or a withdrawal. This categorization is orthodox enough 
for most to understand, but negative betrayals, in particular, are sometimes categorized as positive betrayals, 
depending on the complexity of the situation. Actions classified as negative betrayals can also be due to incompetence, 
rather than a choiceful negligence. 

Misanthropy and deception. This correlation is obvious enough. The quote, "all war is based on deception", is attributed 
to the famous Sun Tzu. And war, as anyone knows, is greatly driven by a malice if not a harnessed hatred heartfelt and 
molding of the mind towards single-minded fatalist ends. Deception is one way of life, and is still much an aspect of 
human civilizations officially at peace. It seems that the higher up on the hierarchy of economic sectors, the highest 
of the sectors comprising a small part of services work, especially those focused on politics and money, deception becomes 
more prevalent in some way but less prominent to detect. This has to do with the metaphysics of services work, and the 
fact that services work rests on top of physical work and product means that the physical world, the world of motion 
and material, is the cause to rightfully attribute deception to. These attributions do have reason to them. 

Misanthropy and identity and culture. Cultural distinctions are kinds of barriers to entry for others. These distinctions 
can be impossible for outsiders to imitate without appearing foolish and insincere. Identity has degrees of narcissism 
to it, yet the narcissism can be conveniently masked by shared identities, in other words, labels that can fit two 
instead of one are labels that bond the two instead of pitting them against one another. Misanthropy gradually shifts 
perspective from dislike of a few groups or a dislike of no groups to a distaste for the eventualities caused by 
differences in cultural compatibility. 

Misanthropy and the masses. Misanthropy tends to be aversion towards masses rather than elites, although a significant 
portion of misanthropy can be traced back to practices and conducts by elites. Misanthropy can come off as an ostentatious 
behavior that the misanthrope presents. Misanthropes of this variety could act foolish and nonsensical as an indirect 
insult to the seriousness of issues presented by the masses. However, this variety of misanthropy can also act sanctimonious, 
with a strong touch of stoicism, chosen as a foil to the masses conceptualized as nonsensical idiots. There is a wide 
spectrum of attitudes in misanthropy of the masses. One aspect, which may be difficult to detect, is the elitism that 
is more from mentality than from status or wealth. 

Misanthropy and determinism. Ideas that some human beings are where they are at due to overarching concepts such as 
structural inequality or perhaps something more specific and personal, such as conspiracy, could lead the way to misanthropy 
of human ends and their means. The intentional things some people say, the way they dress, who they choose to address, who 
they choose to endorse, these decisions, either directly impacting another human being or be in their presence in ways 
that cannot be so easily shooed away, encourage negative sentiments. Those negative sentiments translate to a generalized 
and indiscriminate distaste for humanity. The list of some broad sources of negative sentiments are incomplete, since 
they did not include more grievous phenomena such as forced labor, physical wars, and maladaptive situations. Being assigned 
fixed roles, and to make matters less ideal, there were unmentioned expectations for those roles before they were assigned, 
is another major cause of misanthropy, a misanthropy that attempts to transcend the personal anger and suffering by 
indiscriminately ascribing the causes to the fault of humanity at large. 

Misanthropy and messaging. Repetitive and annoying messaging constitutes one of many psychological weapons. Psychological 
aggravation can induce or grow misanthropic sentiments. Messaging may fall under one or more of these labels: mocking/derisive, 
fallacious, truism, patronizing, and useless. 

Misanthropy from the lack of absolutism. Misanthropes, as reactionaries to the lack of absolutism, also are greatly appreciative 
of systematic practices beneficial to them. Having to always split off time and resources and allegiance to more than just their 
ideal devotions are costly, and misanthropy sees these costs as unnecessary and destructive to their aims. These misanthropes 
come from all walks of life, including royalty that demands tribute, bureaucrats that aspire for law and order, and others that 
did not receive what they expected, even though they followed through on the system guidelines for their objectives. An aversion 
to illogical ways, metastacized into placing responsibility of fault onto many members of humanity. 

Misanthropy as a practice nurtured in open-ended free environments. This is the polar opposite to the kind spurred from the 
lack of absolutism. These misanthropes will appear meek and somber in their surroundings, typically diversified in cultural and 
racial backgrounds and under left-leaning agenda. These misanthropes tend to play along with scripts, acting as open and carefree 
as the next person to them, and might also be more loose in principle than the kinds of misanthropy sourced from determinism. 

Many misanthropes will, in fact, maintain cooperation in their systems of operation, all the while becoming tone-deaf to pleas 
from the other side. Many misanthropes will choose to limit interaction with other people for "their peace of mind", and these 
chosen limitations would indeed make them about as helpless as those they may have viewed as being unhelpful to them in the past.
